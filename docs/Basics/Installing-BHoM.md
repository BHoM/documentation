# Installing BHoM
We recommend using the BHoM Installer for most situations. 

The latest installer can always be downloaded from [bhom.xyz](https://bhom.xyz/).

Make sure all instances of Rhino, Excel and Revit are closed when installing BHoM.

Contributors, as well as those who need a special version of a toolkit, may need to compile the source code themselves. Have a look at [Getting started for developers](/Contributing/Getting-started-for-developers).
