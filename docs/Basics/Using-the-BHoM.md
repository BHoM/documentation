The BHoM has been built from the ground with the aim to enable use of BHoM tools and participation in computational design across both the broadest of skill sets as well as the most diverse areas of expertise.

This means there are a number of different entry points to get started with using the BHoM depending on what you want to acheive, and what your background is.

The BHoM is all about thinking about our design as workflows and data models: inputs, processes and outputs. BHoM therefore loves flow based visual programming! 

The BHoM has two community developed and supported plugins giving access to BHoM functionality in our favourite computational design environments:
BHoM for Grasshopper and BHoM for Excel 


Two great places to start are therefore our introductry guides:

1. [Getting started with the BHoM in visual programming](<../Guides and Tutorials/Visual Programming with BHoM/index.md>) This is a great entry point to explore many of the basic concepts

2. [Getting started with coding in the BHoM for developers](<../Guides and Tutorials/Coding with BHoM/Getting-started-for-developers.md>) The BHoM has been designed as an open framework, ready to be be built on top of, extended and customisied. Being open source all the code is fully explorable on GitHub. So if you are a coder this is a great We can't wait to see what you build!
