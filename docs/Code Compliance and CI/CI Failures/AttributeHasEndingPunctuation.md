## Summary

**Severity** - Warning

**Check method** - [Here](https://github.com/BHoM/Test_Toolkit/blob/master/CodeComplianceTest_Engine/Query/Checks/AttributeHasEndingPunctuation.cs)

## Details

The `AttributeHasEndingPunctuation` check ensures that an attribute providing documentation (`input`, `description` `output` or `multioutput`) ends with a suitable piece of punctuation. See the check method for the current accepted list.

This check is useful for helping provide delineation between the documentation you provide as the developer, and the documentation provided automatically on components within the UI.
