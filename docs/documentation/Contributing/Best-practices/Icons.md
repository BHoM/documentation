## General Guidelines

As a general rule, the icons are stored in the [BHoM_UI repository](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_UI). All other UIs will then use those directly so there is no need for each UI to create its own icons.

## Software Specific Guidelines

* **Grasshopper** icons are 24x24px png files and follow [David Ruttens Guidelines](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/grasshopper-icons-vector-sourc).
A recommended workflow is to export a 24x24px png from Inkscape with a 20x20px vector inside it and then use Gimp to add a dropshadow. 

## Useful Software

* [**Gimp**](https://www.gimp.org/), a free image editor.

* [**Inkscape**](https://inkscape.org/en/), a free vector graphics editor.
