## Preparation of the code and repository

Tasks to be completed before migration to public organisation.  
To be carried out/reviewed by the Repository Owner:
#### Licencing and copyright
- Ensure repository has valid licence file.  
 BHoM defaults to LGPL v3 https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/master/LICENSE.  
 Repositories _can_ naturally be licenced differently, but by exception only and through coordination with BHoM Organisation Administrators. In addition this will also require modifications to the repo's copyright headers in every code file.
- All code files must have a valid BHoM copyright header compatible with licencing (see point above) 
  See here for the default https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/master/COPYRIGHT_HEADER.txt
- Assembly information and the included copyright must also conform to BHoM standards.  
 Such as `[assembly: AssemblyCopyright("Copyright Â© https://github.com/BHoM")]`
