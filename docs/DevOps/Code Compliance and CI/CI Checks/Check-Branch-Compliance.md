# Check Branch Compliance

This check will confirm the branch name for the pull request matches [the guidelines](Resolving-an-Issue#branch-naming-conventions).

If the check is unsuccessful, it will remind you of the conventions for next time. Following the conventions on branch naming is very important for CI processes.
