# Check Project Compliance

This check will confirm the `csproj` files changed within a pull request are compliant with [the guidelines](https://bhom.xyz/documentation/DevOps/Code%20Compliance%20and%20CI/Compliance%20Checks/Project-References-and-Build-Paths/) for project files.

If the check is unsuccessful, you can trigger BHoMBot to make the fixes for you. This can be accessed by viewing the details of the check and clicking the `Fix` button to trigger the process on the pull request.
