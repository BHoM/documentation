# Introduction to DevOps

This is the section dedicated to **DevOps**. 
Within the following pages of this section, you will find more information about our DevOps practices, procedures and ways of working that facilitate cohesion and collaboration across the BHoM. 

## What is DevOps?

The word DevOps is a combination of the terms *development* and *operations*. The vision of DevOps is to have a smooth, streamlined and sophistical cycle for development, deployment and to provide improvements across the BHoM Community. 

This includes:

- Providing a framework for development and deployment
- Providing safety nets for development to occur with minimal risk
- Providing continous deployment of tools
- Reduce the time needed to complete the development cycle
