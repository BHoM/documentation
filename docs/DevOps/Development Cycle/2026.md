## Sprint Cadence

Each development cycle follows a consistent structure:

- **Planning Week** — Backlog refinement, sprint planning, and alignment across teams
- **Sprints 1–6** — Two-week development sprints with defined deliverables
- **Beta Release** — End of cycle release for testing and validation

All sprints run Monday through Friday. Sprint boundaries align to facilitate coordination across our global contributor network.
