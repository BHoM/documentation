All of the repositories within the BHoM organisation contain only ___curated and strongly controlled code___. 
The aim is to provide a coherent set of tools that are all compatible with each other. As well as clear and robust quality control, review and testing procedures - enabling release across a wider part of the practice.

Make sure the team has the same name as the repo and that you have added the repo into its list of repositories with the the **"Write"** access level. Now you should be able to link it in the branch setup page above.
