# What is BHoM versioning?

BHoM versioning provides a system to correctly load a method or component stored in a script that has had its code changed.

## Why is Versioning needed?

When you save a script that contains BHoM stuff, all of the BHoM components save information about themselves so they can initialise properly when the script is re-opened. This information is about things like the component/method name, its inputs and outputs types and names; the information is simply stored in a text (Json serialised).

If someone changes a BHoM method or object that was stored in a script, upon reopening of the script it will be impossible to reload that same method or object: the method initialisation will fail and the old component in the script will throw a warning or error, unable to work. 

Versioning fixes this by updating the old json text before using it to find the method. 

## What does BHoM versioning support?

Upgrading/downgrading of the following modifications:

- BHoM methods (e.g. saved in a script): changes in the method name
- BHoM methods (e.g. saved in a script): changes in input/outputs names and types
- BHoM objects (e.g. internalised in a script or stored in a file or database): changes in their properties
- BHoM objects (e.g. internalised in a script or stored in a file or database): changes in their name
- Changes in Namespaces
