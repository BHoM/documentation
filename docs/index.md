### What is BHoM?

The **BHoM** (**Buildings and Habitats object Model**) is a framework for AEC, a collection of _schemas_, _functions_ and _schema conversions_. 

The BHoM schema -- called BHoM Object Model -- contains definitions for any kind of AEC concept: 
from physical concepts (e.g. columns, floors, etc.) to theoretical concepts (structural forces, light, etc.).

Further, BHoM offers several functions that can operate on the BHoM objects. For example, you can derive calculations or quantities from given objects, like the total weight of a set of BHoM columns.

The objects and functions are software-agnostic, and you can access it from command line, or from specific software, like Grasshopper, Excel, Revit, etc.

To export/import from the BHoM format to other software, BHoM offers several _adapters_ that can convert to/from BHoM, so you can export/import from e.g. Autodesk Robot, Revit, Grasshopper, etc.

In short, BHoM aims to standardise the _data_ and the functionality that operates on data, in an open-source way.

### BHoM VS other AEC frameworks

BHoM focuses on defining _concepts_ without a focus on a particular software or graphical interface.
BHoM is transdisciplinary, software-agnostic and office/region/country-invariant.

### Embracing open-source
The whole **BHoM** project uses an open-source model for project architecture, co-creation and planning. 

So explore, experiment and contribute to both the source code and the wiki. 

Sharing and building our code together in this open-source type approach means we can feed off and pool our disparate knowledge, experience and expertise towards a common goal â€“ better design.
