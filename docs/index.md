### So - what exactly is the BHoM?

The **BHoM** (**Buildings and Habitats object Model**) is a collaborative computational development project for the built environment.  
BHoM aims to standardise the data and functionality that AEC domain experts use to design across all disciplines.

BHoM is a collection of _schemas_, _functionality_ and _conversions_. 
BHoM aims to standardise the _data_, and the functionality that operates on it, in the belief that this provides great opportunities for efficiency, for collaboration and most of all, to improve the way we work.

### BHoM tries to avoid common pitfalls of other AEC frameworks
BHoM does not attempt to standardise exact processes, because these must be flexible.
BHoM does not aim to be an holistic software solution to replace established software used and loved by people.
BHoM is not designed as a data-sharing platform, like Speckle or BIM360; although it can be used in synergy with them, BHoM attempts to unify the "shape" of the data, and the functionality that can operate on it, rather than how the data is shared.


### An agnostic framework
BHoM is crafted as transdisciplinary, software-agnostic and office/region/country-invariant, and therefore would be nothing without our active community and wide range of contributors.

### Embracing open-source
The whole **BHoM** project uses an open-source model for project architecture, co-creation and planning. So explore, experiment and contribute to both the source code and the wiki. Sharing and building our code together in this open-source type approach means we can feed off and pool our disparate knowledge, experience and expertise towards a common goal â€“ better design.
