## So - what exactly is the BHoM?

The **BHoM** (**Buildings and Habitats object Model**) is a collaborative computational development project for the built environment. It is a collective effort to share code and standardise the data that we use to design, everyday – across all activities and all disciplines.

It is not an attempt to standardise exact processes – these must be flexible...

It is also not an attempt to standardise the software we use...

BHoM is a collection of _schemas_, _functionality_ and _conversions_. BHoM aims to standardise the _data_, not the data-_base_, in the belief that this provides great opportunities for efficiency, for collaboration and most of all, to improve the way we work within any Building Habitat.

### An agnostic framework
BHoM is crafted as transdisciplinary, software-agnostic and office/region/country-invariant, and therefore would be nothing without our active community and wide range of contributors.

### Embracing open-source
The whole **BHoM** project uses an open-source model for project architecture, co-creation and planning. So explore, experiment and contribute to both the source code and the wiki. Sharing and building our code together in this open-source type approach means we can feed off and pool our disparate knowledge, experience and expertise towards a common goal – better design.
