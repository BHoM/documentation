# Revit Toolkit intro

Welcome to the [Revit Toolkit](https://github.com/BHoM/Revit_Toolkit/) documentation! 

Here you will find information on what Revit_Toolkit can do for you as well as how to make that (and even more) happen. 

Feel free to explore and raise an [issue](https://github.com/BHoM/Revit_Toolkit/issues) if you need or do not like something. Enjoy!

## Overview
Revit_Toolkit includes a range of support classes and methods that extend the core BHoM to embrace the complexity of Revit. These, among others, are:

- [dedicated Requests](../../Visual-Programming-with-BHoM/Revit Toolkit/Pull/Requests and Filtering) supported by a range of filtering methods that allow specified queries
- BHoM wrappers for Revit elements: `Sheets`, `Viewports`, `IViews`, `DraftingInstances`, `ModelInstances` etc.
- general methods to process Revit elements and documents, mainly for conversion and adapter processing purposes

All relevant methods and classes are `public`, therefore other applications can be built upon the code base of Revit_Toolkit ([see simple Forms app sample](https://github.com/BHoM/samples/tree/master/Revit_Toolkit/C%23)).
