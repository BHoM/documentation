# The Object Model (oM): define new objects

This section introduces the `BHoMObject`, which is the foundational class for most of the Objects found in BHoM.

We also introduce the `IObject`, the base interface for everything in BHoM.

## BHoMObject Code Structure and Content

A typical BHoM object definition is given simply by defining a class with some public properties. _That's it!_ No constructors or anything needed here.

Here is an example of what a BHoM object definition looks like:

```c#
using BH.oM.Base;
using BH.oM.Geometry;

namespace BH.oM.Acoustic
{
    public class Speaker : BHoMObject
    {
        /***************************************************/
        /**** Properties                                ****/
        /***************************************************/

        public Point Position { get; set; } = new Point();

        public Vector Direction { get; set; } = new Vector();

        public string Category { get; set; } = "";

        /***************************************************/
    }
}
```

In general, most classes defined in BHoM are a BHoM object, except particular cases. 
Among these exceptions, you can find **Geometry** and **Result** types.
The reason for this is both conceptual and to aid performance. Geometries and Results are not "objects" in the strict sense of the term. In addition, separating those types from actual `BHoMObject` objects greatly helps with performance down the line.


## Inheritance from BHoMObject

Note that the name of a class in a new object definition is followed by ` : BHoMObject`. This is to say that this object inherits from `BHoMObject`. This is important if you want your new class to benefit from the properties and functionalities a BHoM object provides. 

Here is a part of the BHoMObject class definition:

```c#
namespace BH.oM.Base
{
    public class BHoMObject : IObject
    {
        /***************************************************/
        /**** Properties                                ****/
        /***************************************************/

        public Guid BHoM_Guid { get; set; } = Guid.NewGuid();

        public string Name { get; set; } = "";

        public HashSet<string> Tags { get; set; } = new HashSet<string>();

        public Dictionary<string, object> CustomData { get; set; } = new Dictionary<string, object>();

   }
}
```

As you can see, **the `BHoMObject` only contains a set of properties**. 

As for any other class in the BHoM framework, we try to keep behaviour (functions, methods) and properties separated. Minor exceptions to this separation are seldom made for for practical efficiency and technical reasons. 
The functionalities of the `BHoMObject`, as well as of the other BHoM framework types, are defined in the [BHoM_Engine](/BH.Engine-‚Äê-Create-New-Algorithms).

## Everything is an IObject

As we said before, not everything is an `BHoMObject`: exceptions are Geometry and Results objects.

However, in order to easily identify all the types coming from the BHoM framework, a basic type, or `interface`, is needed. 

That's why everything is defined to be an `IObject` at its root. All BHoM objects will always be an `IObject`, as  `BHoMObject` is itself inheriting from `IObject`. Everything else will be too through the chain of interfaces.

Let's have a look at one of the Geometry objects, `Pipe`. As you can see, it inherits from ISurface, one of the base `Geometry` types.

```c#
namespace BH.oM.Geometry
{
    public class Pipe : ISurface
    {
        /***************************************************/
        /**** Properties                                ****/
        /***************************************************/

        public ICurve Centreline { get; set; } = new Line();

        public double Radius { get; set; } = 0;

        public bool Capped { get; set; } = true;

        /***************************************************/
    }
}
```

The interface `ISurface` inherits from another interface, `IGeometry`:

```c#
namespace BH.oM.Geometry
{
    public interface ISurface : IGeometry {}
}
```
And finally, `IGeometry` inherits from `IObject`, which as we said will always be the top-level of any type defined in the BHoM framework:

```c#
namespace BH.oM.Geometry
{
    public interface IGeometry : IObject {}
}
```

## Defining Properties

Properties correspond to the information you need to define your object (to the exception of the properties the BHoMObject class already provides). A few things to keep in mind when you create those:

- All properties must be public and have a public get and set methods, written `{get; set;}`. (This means that `readonly` properties are not directly allowed - see paragraph below "Immutable Objects" if you want to know more).
- Make sure you provide a default value X for your properties by using `= X;` at the end of their definition; If a properties is too complex to be defined that way, simply set it to null (write `= null;` at the end).

As objects grow in complexity, it is useful to think in terms of splitting an object's properties into categories:
1. Object _**Defining**_ properties. The minimal required information you need to construct the full object. 
These should generally be the properties of the objects defined in the BHoM

2. _**Derived**_ properties. 
Any property that could be calculated from the other properties. These should generally be handled by the BHoM_Engine using extension methods. This choice allows to  calculate and obtain those properties only when needed; however, it also mean that you will have to write an explicit "get" method that users will be able to access through the dot `.` accessor.

3. _**Software specific**_ properties such as Software IDs, etc. To ensure that the BHoM is software agnostic, we resorted to store this information in a dynamic (not statically typed) way. That's why we're using a `Dictionary` (list of key-value pairs) property of the BHoMObject called `CustomData`.
For example, the ID assigned to an object for a certain software will be stored as a value of the Key `softwareName_id`. 

4. _**Results**_ from analysis. These are to be generally stored as a completely different set of classes, as you can have thousands of results per object.

As an example between _Defining_ and _Derived_ properties for geometry: 
A line is **defined** by two points. These two points are properties of the line (category 1).
A line can also have a length, but as that can be **derived** from the points, this instead sits in the BHoM_Engine as a method called "Length()" (category 2).
This structure makes sure that on update of the points, the length will also be updated ensuring compatibility of properties at all times.


## Defining Constructors and Local Methods

**Important:** To the exception of [Immutable Objects](#immutable-objects), BHoM objects should never have a constructor. In general, there should be no method defined in the class either (see [Casting methods](#casting-methods)). So, ultimately, a BHoM object is really nothing more than a list of properties and their default values. Objects will be created either by using an [Object Initialiser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers) or one of the [Create.X](BHoM_Engine-Namespaces#create) method from the [Engine](/BHoM_Engine). 

Anything that manipulates data should generally be in the [BHoM Engine](/BHoM_Engine). That being said, there are rare occasions where you will see a local method written directly in the object definition. Those methods are generally created there for optimisation reasons or because of the constraints of C# and are therefore the exception, not the rule.

For those of you coming from object oriented programming, it might seems quite unnatural to take functionality outside a class as much as possible. There is a few reasons why we have gone that direction:

* Properties of an object are unlikely to change frequently and it is reasonable to expect a list of properties to converge quickly to a final solution, never to be touched again. The methods, on the other hand are always growing, improving or being debugged. Keeping them in more isolated packages will reduce the impact of their change.
* We want as many people to be able to contribute as possible. While not everyone will be able to write complex algorithms, we expect every engineer to be able to define what properties should be found in an object he/she is using regularly. By separating the complexity levels in different repos, people are enabled to participate by focusing on the part they are comfortable with.
* Some of the contributors to the BHoM might wish to keep a few methods and algorithms related to a BHoM object private. By limiting the BHoM to object definitions, we are making it easier to share the object models without being forced to share anything else. Do not worry though, the Engine already contains plenty of useful methods and is constantly growing.

The main disadvantage is that the hierarchical structure of the repositories makes mandatory to update/rebuild any other repository that comes down. For example, any change to the BHoM repository means there is large ripple effect on nearly every other repository.

## Namespace and Folder Structure

- BHoM objects are organised as shown in the image below. All analytical objects are stored in their respective discipline project (e.g. _**Structure**_, _**Environment**_,...).  
- A _**Common**_ project is user for objects shared between disciplines. 
- The inter-disciplinary representation is expressed through physical objects (stored in the **_Physical_** folder).
- Finally, the _**BHoM**_ and _**Geometry**_ folders contain core objects and geometry definitions respectively.

Namespaces have to match the folder structure. 

In the rare case where folders are more than 3 levels deep, the namespaces are allowed to stop there. For example, the _**BH.oM.Structure.Results**_ folder contains subfolders. Objects defined in those subfolders are allowed to use the namespace _**BH.oM.Structure.Results**_ instead of _**BH.oM.Structure.Results.SubFolder**_.

## Immutable Objects

**Warning**: This is more advanced feature and not necessary in 99% of the case so you can safely skip this.

For some rare objects, it would be problematic to keep only the **Defining** properties. That is generally the case if the **Derived** properties are very expensive to compute. In that case, those objects should inherit from the `IImutable` interface. This is explicitly stating that the properties of those objects should not be modified as it would create inconsistencies within the object. In that case, the properties that are overlapping would only have a `{ get; }` accessor instead of the usual `{ get; set; }`. Here's an example of such a class (with some skipped section highlighted as `...`)

```c#
public class CableSection : BHoMObject, ISectionProperty, IImmutable
{
    /***************************************************/
    /**** Properties                                ****/
    /***************************************************/

    public Material Material { get; set; } = null;

    /***************************************************/
    /**** Properties - Section dimensions           ****/
    /***************************************************/

    public int NumberOfCables { get; } = 0;

    public double CableDiameter { get; } = 0;

    public CableType CableType { get; } = CableType.FullLockedCoil;

    public double BreakingLoad { get; }

    ...

    /***************************************************/
    /**** Constructors                              ****/
    /***************************************************/

    public CableSection(...)
    {
        ...
    }

    /***************************************************/
}
```

Apart from the use of `{ get; }` instead of `{ get; set; }`, you will notice that `IImmutable` objects will have to define their own constructors inside the class. This is because [Object Initialiser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers) do not work on properties without a `set` so we cannot simply define the constructors in the Engine as we usually do.

## Casting Methods

**Warning**: This is more advanced feature and not necessary in 99% of the case so you can safely skip this.

It is convenient for some objects to be able to be casted from something else. For Example, a geometrical Point could be casted from a Vector or a structural Node could be casted from a Point. This is especially useful inside a user interface. Here's an example where this case is relevant:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuroHappoldEngineering/documentation-page/main/docs/_images/ExplicitCastingInUI.png)

```c#
public class Node : BHoMObject
{
    /***************************************************/
    /**** Properties                                ****/
    /***************************************************/

    public Point Position { get; set; } = new Point();

    public Constraint6DOF Constraint { get; set; } = null;


    /***************************************************/
    /**** Explicit Casting                          ****/
    /***************************************************/

    public static explicit operator Node(Point point)
    {
        return new Node { Position = point };
    }

    /***************************************************/
}
```
As you can see, we can skip the step of creating a Node since it would only need the Point anyway.

Unfortunately, C# doesn't allow to define this outside the class so we have no choice but to do it in the BHoM. Be mindful that this is only relevant when an object could be created from a single other element so this only apply in unique cases and shouldn't be defined in every class.
